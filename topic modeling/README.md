script</a>. You need to make some adjustments to the code to specify the location of your PDF file and where to save
the generated text file.

After this, you need to execute the <a href="https://github.com/great-ufc/migration-on-premise-cloud-mapping/tree/main/topic%20modeling/ldavis.py">
topic modeling script</a>. Note that you need to make some changes in the code to adjust the path to your directory containing the text files.
